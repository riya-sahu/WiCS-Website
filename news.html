            <p>We discussed the logistics of how the club was going to run this year.</p>
            <p>At the end, we ran a miniature hackathon with prizes to demonstrate how we can develop solutions to real-world problems.</p>
            <p>The prompt was: Create an application, website, or other program to help people become more familiar with English slang.</p>
            <p>Congratulations to our winners! And thank you to all those who attended the meeting.</p>
